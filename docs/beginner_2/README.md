# üî∞ Beginner 2 - Common Programming Terms & Basic Conversations

## üìö **Level Description**

Building on your foundation from Beginner 1, this level expands your programming vocabulary and teaches you how to engage in basic technical conversations. You'll learn more programming terms and practice using them in context.

## üéØ **Main Content**

### 1. **Expanded Programming Vocabulary**

#### **Object-Oriented Programming Terms**
```markdown
# OOP Vocabulary

## Classes & Objects
- **class** - a blueprint for creating objects
- **object** - an instance of a class
- **instance** - a specific object created from a class
- **constructor** - a special method that initializes an object
- **method** - a function that belongs to a class
- **property** - a characteristic or attribute of an object

## Inheritance & Relationships
- **inherit** - to receive properties and methods from a parent class
- **parent class** - the class being inherited from
- **child class** - the class that inherits from another
- **override** - to replace a method from the parent class
- **extend** - to create a child class from a parent class
```

#### **Database & Data Terms**
```markdown
# Database Vocabulary

## Basic Concepts
- **database** - a collection of organized data
- **table** - a structure that holds data in rows and columns
- **record** - a single row of data in a table
- **field** - a single column of data in a table
- **query** - a request for data from a database
- **index** - a structure that improves data retrieval speed

## Common Actions
- **insert** - to add new data
- **select** - to retrieve data
- **update** - to modify existing data
- **delete** - to remove data
- **join** - to combine data from multiple tables
```

### 2. **Enhanced Sentence Structures**

#### **Complex Sentences with Programming Terms**
```markdown
# Advanced Sentence Patterns

## Using Technical Terms
- "The class constructor initializes the object properties."
- "We need to override the parent method to customize the behavior."
- "The database query joins three tables to get the complete user information."

## Explaining Processes
- "First, we create a new instance of the User class."
- "Then, we call the validate method to check the input data."
- "Finally, we save the validated data to the database."

## Describing Relationships
- "The Customer class extends the User class."
- "This method belongs to the DatabaseManager class."
- "The API endpoint connects to the authentication service."
```

#### **Technical Explanations**
```markdown
# Explaining Technical Concepts

## Simple Explanations
- "A class is like a template for creating objects."
- "Inheritance allows us to reuse code from other classes."
- "An index helps the database find data faster."

## Process Descriptions
- "When a user logs in, the system creates a session."
- "The application reads the configuration file on startup."
- "The cache stores frequently used data in memory."
```

### 3. **Practical Conversations**

#### **Code Review Discussions**
```markdown
# Code Review Language

## Giving Feedback
- "This method is well-structured and easy to understand."
- "Consider adding error handling for edge cases."
- "The variable names are clear and descriptive."
- "This code follows the project's coding standards."

## Asking Questions
- "Why did you choose this approach?"
- "How does this handle the null case?"
- "What happens if the database connection fails?"
- "Can you explain this algorithm in more detail?"

## Responding to Feedback
- "I'll add error handling to make it more robust."
- "Good point, I'll refactor this for better readability."
- "I'll add comments to explain the complex logic."
- "Thanks for catching that edge case."
```

#### **Team Collaboration**
```markdown
# Team Communication

## Planning Discussions
- "What's the best approach for implementing this feature?"
- "How long do you think this will take to complete?"
- "What are the potential risks we should consider?"
- "Who should we involve in the code review?"

## Status Updates
- "I'm currently working on the user authentication module."
- "I've completed the database schema design."
- "I'm stuck on the API integration part."
- "I need help with the testing framework setup."

## Problem Solving
- "We're experiencing performance issues with large datasets."
- "The deployment failed due to missing environment variables."
- "Users are reporting errors in the mobile app."
- "We need to optimize the database queries."
```
