### 2. **Programming Context Examples**

#### **Code Comments in English**
```javascript
// This is a simple comment
// Create a variable to store user name
let userName = "John";

// Check if user is logged in
if (userLoggedIn) {
    // Show welcome message
    displayWelcome(userName);
} else {
    // Ask user to log in
    showLoginForm();
}
```

#### **Simple Documentation**
```markdown
# User Authentication System

## Description
This system checks if a user is logged in.

## How to Use
1. Call the checkUser function
2. Pass the user ID as parameter
3. Function returns true or false

## Example
```javascript
let isLoggedIn = checkUser(123);
```
```

### 3. **Basic Conversations**

#### **Developer to Developer**
```markdown
# Simple Technical Conversations

## Asking for Help
- "Can you help me with this code?"
- "What does this error mean?"
- "How do I fix this bug?"

## Explaining Code
- "This function creates a new user."
- "The loop goes through each item."
- "We use this variable to store the result."

## Giving Instructions
- "First, create a new file."
- "Then, add this code."
- "Finally, test the function."
```

#### **Team Communication**
```markdown
# Basic Team Communication

## Daily Standup
- "Yesterday I worked on the login feature."
- "Today I will fix the bug in the database."
- "I need help with the API integration."

## Code Review
- "This code looks good."
- "Can you add more comments?"
- "The function name is clear."
```
